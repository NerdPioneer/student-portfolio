                <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-600 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-200">I'm a results-driven, mission-focused Cloud Computing Student at Western Governors University with 5 years of experience in cybersecurity and IT operations. I began my career as a Security Analyst, where I built a strong foundation in Linux administration, incident response, and Python scripting — skills I continued to sharpen through hands-on experience and academic training.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-400">Over the years, I've shifted my focus toward cloud security and infrastructure. I've worked extensively with platforms like AWS and Azure, often in high-compliance environments where strict rules are in place. <strong>What does that mean?</strong> It means I spend a lot of time digging into official documentation, understanding the policies and regulations that govern how data must be stored, accessed, and protected. I translate those dense rulebooks into practical steps configurations, processes, and safeguards that keep systems secure while still running smoothly.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-400">My mindset is simple: consistent growth over time. I treat every project, lab, and challenge as a chance to improve. Whether I'm writing code, studying for school, or building systems, I bring the same mindset — show up, improve, and keep moving forward. I'm building these skills with the goal of contributing as much value as possible to the defense industry and related fields.</p>
