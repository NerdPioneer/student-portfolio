                <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-gray-600 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-200">I grew up around computers—Windows Vista machines that crashed constantly, and MacBooks that just worked. That contrast taught me something early: using tech is easy. Understanding why it works (or fails) is what matters.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-400">Cloud computing made my direction clear because it's not just "another IT topic." It changes how systems are built, shipped, and scaled. I didn't want a career built on copying tutorials. I wanted to understand the fundamentals well enough to build, troubleshoot, and improve real systems.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-400">That's why I chose Western Governors University for a B.S. in Cloud Computing. My focus is networking and infrastructure: how data moves, where systems break, and how to design so failures don't turn into outages. I practice networking in Cisco Packet Tracer, then reinforce it with Python—automating small tasks, validating configs, and building scripts that make systems more consistent.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-400">I also work intentionally across data fundamentals—learning when relational databases make sense, when NoSQL is the better fit, and what you give up in each tradeoff. Security stays in the loop throughout, because reliability without security is fake reliability.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-400">An early internship at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__yvh7Vc8EE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 underline transition-colors duration-200">Trend Micro CPITS Program</a> made the lesson obvious: weak design gets exposed fast. Since then, I've treated every project like training—clear work, solid basics, and steady improvement.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-4 animate-slide-up animation-delay-400">This site is where I document that work: projects, notes, and progress. If you want to understand how I think and what I can do, start with the projects.</p>
